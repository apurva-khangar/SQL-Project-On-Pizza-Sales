# SQL-Project-On-Pizza-Sales
In this project, I built and analyzed a pizza sales database to identify key insights such as top-selling pizzas, peak sales periods, customer preferences, and overall revenue trends. Using SQL queries, I was able to extract meaningful business insights that can help a pizza shop improve decision-making, optimize their menu, and increase profits.
